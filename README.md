Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

##### Task:
Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena. \
Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total) over a timespan of your choosing. \
Design a dashboard for each phenomena with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may be occuring. \
Create a static or dynamic map to visual some of the data. \
Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards. \
This is what will be presented to the officials, so be sure to make it professional, logical, and visually appealing.

##### Timespan Analyzed:
Jan-Dec 2019 \
Data From: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data  -  https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html \
The data was combined and reduced in size using Pandas/Jupyter Notebook to make it simple to load to and compatible with Tableau Public. 

#### Final Analysis on Tableau Public
